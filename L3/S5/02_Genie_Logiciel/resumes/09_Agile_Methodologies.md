# 🏃‍♂️ Agile Methodologies & Principles: An Expert Academic Guide

> **Expert Perspective:** In the context of Software Engineering (Génie Logiciel), Agile is not just a "way of working"—it is a fundamental shift from predictive (Waterfall) to adaptive (Iterative) development. For an L3 student, the key is to understand *why* we use Agile and *how* its ceremonies and artifacts ensure software quality.

## 1. The Agile Manifesto: The Four Pillars
The Agile Manifesto (2001) redefined software development by prioritizing human factors and flexibility over rigid processes.

| Traditional (Waterfall) | Agile Priority |
| :--- | :--- |
| Processes and Tools | **Individuals and Interactions** |
| Comprehensive Documentation | **Working Software** |
| Contract Negotiation | **Customer Collaboration** |
| Following a Plan | **Responding to Change** |

## 2. Core Agile Principles (The "Expert" Selection)
While there are 12 principles, examiners focus on these four critical concepts:

### A. Iterative & Incremental Development
Instead of delivering the whole system at once, we deliver small, functional pieces (Increments) in short time-boxes (Iterations/Sprints).
*   **Why?** Reduces risk and allows for early feedback.

### B. Continuous Integration (CI)
Developers merge their code into a shared repository frequently.
*   **Why?** To detect "integration hell" early and ensure the system is always in a deployable state.

### C. Self-Organizing Teams
Teams decide how to best accomplish their work, rather than being directed by a manager.
*   **Why?** Increases ownership, motivation, and speed of decision-making.

### D. Sustainable Pace
Agile promotes a work-life balance to maintain high quality over the long term.

## 3. Agile Methods: Scrum & Kanban

### 🔹 Scrum (The Framework)
Scrum is the most common Agile framework used in exams. It is structured around specific roles, events, and artifacts.

*   **Roles:**
    *   **Product Owner:** Represents the customer, manages the Product Backlog.
    *   **Scrum Master:** Facilitator, removes "impediments," ensures Scrum is followed.
    *   **Development Team:** Cross-functional group that builds the increment.
*   **Events:** Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.
*   **Artifacts:** Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.

### 🔹 Kanban (The Visual Flow)
Focuses on "Just-In-Time" delivery and limiting **Work In Progress (WIP)**.
*   **Key Tool:** The Kanban Board (To Do | Doing | Done).
*   **Goal:** Optimize the flow of work and identify bottlenecks.

## 🔸 How this appears in exams

### Typical Theory Questions
1.  **Compare Waterfall vs. Agile:** Focus on "Change Management" and "Customer Involvement."
2.  **Define the Scrum Roles:** Be precise about the difference between a Scrum Master and a Project Manager.
3.  **Explain "WIP" in Kanban:** Why is limiting WIP important? (Answer: To prevent bottlenecks and multitasking).

### Typical Justification Questions
*   *"A startup is building a new mobile app with rapidly changing requirements. Which methodology should they use?"*
    *   **Expert Answer:** Agile (Scrum), because it allows for **Responding to Change** through short iterations and frequent customer feedback.

## 🔸 What the professor checks during correction
*   **Terminology:** Using terms like "Sprint," "Backlog," and "Increment" correctly.
*   **Logic:** Understanding that Agile is not "no documentation," but "just enough documentation."
*   **Context:** Knowing when Agile is *not* suitable (e.g., critical safety systems with fixed, rigid requirements).

---

## 🔸 Frequent mistakes to avoid
*   ❌ **Confusing Scrum Master with a Boss:** The Scrum Master is a *servant-leader*, not a manager who assigns tasks.
*   ❌ **Thinking Agile means "No Planning":** Agile involves *more* frequent planning (Sprint Planning, Daily Standups) than Waterfall.
*   ❌ **Ignoring the "Definition of Done" (DoD):** In exams, always mention that an increment is only finished if it meets the DoD.
