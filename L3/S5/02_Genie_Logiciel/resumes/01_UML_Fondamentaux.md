# 01. UML Fundamentals (Fondamentaux)

### 📝 Core Summary
UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized modeling language used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the artifacts of a software system. It is not a programming language but a graphical notation.

### 🔍 Detailed Explanation

#### 1. What is UML?
UML is the industry standard for documenting software designs. In the context of **Génie Logiciel**, it bridges the gap between requirements and implementation.

#### 2. Why use UML in Exams?
Professors use UML to test your ability to:
- Abstract a real-world problem into a technical model.
- Communicate system architecture without writing code.
- Ensure the system meets functional requirements.

#### 3. The Two Main Categories
UML diagrams are divided into:
- **Structural Diagrams**: Focus on the static aspects (Classes, Objects, Components).
- **Behavioral Diagrams**: Focus on the dynamic aspects (Use Cases, Activities, Sequences, States).

### 🛠️ Key Elements and Notations
- **Diagrams to Master**: Use Case, Class, Sequence, Activity, and State Machine.
- **Common Symbols**:
  - **Rectangles**: Classes or States.
  - **Stick Figures**: Actors.
  - **Arrows**: Relationships or Flow.
  - **Diamonds**: Decisions or Aggregation/Composition.

### 💡 Exam Tips & Common Mistakes
- **Tip**: Always start by identifying the **Actors** and the **Main Goal** of the system.
- **Mistake**: Using the wrong arrow head. A solid triangle `▷` means inheritance, while an open arrow `> ` means association. Mixing them up will lose you points!

### ✍️ Short Training Exercise
**Question**: Is UML a methodology for developing software?
**Solution**: No. UML is a **notation** (language). A methodology (like Scrum or Waterfall) defines the *process*, while UML provides the *tools* to model that process.
